# BUDGET

A simple app to manage your monthly budget, savings, subscriptions (or fixed payments), rent and utilities. It'll be available for both IOS and Android.

This is a simple app I decided to make because I needed an app to manage my budget and rent in university. But I couldn't find an app with the same functions and simplicity. So I decided to make one. That's why I won't add any other major functions later on, it will stay simple.

## The Story

When I started university, I also started living alone. I needed a way of keeping track of my expenses, savings, and rent/utilities. I searched for an easy to use app, but couldn't find an app that didn't include millions of features. So I began looking for a way of creating both IOS and Android apps without having to code them separately. I found Dart and Flutter, and decided to give it a shot. It turned out to be a good experience, even if it's still a bugs nest.

## Status

Currently being developed/tested, and in "Internal Test Track" on Google Play Store.
