# Budget

A simple app to manage your monthly budget, savings, subscriptions (or fixed payments), rent and utilities. It's available for both IOS and Android.

This is a simple app I decided to make because I needed an app to manage my budget and rent in university. But I couldn't find an app with the same functions and simplicity. So I decided to make one. That's why I won't add any other major functions later on, it will stay simple.
